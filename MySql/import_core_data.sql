SALES HEALTH MONITOR - CORE DATA IMPORT SCRIPT
=============================================================
Project: Sales Health Monitor - Phase 5 MySQL Integration
Purpose: Import core datasets into prepared database tables
Author: Chirag Suri
Created: September 4, 2025
Version: 1.0 - Core data import with validation

Prerequisites:
- Database setup completed via database_setup.sql
- CSV files available: sales_cleaned.csv, customers.csv, products.csv
- MySQL Workbench connected as sales_admin user
Expected Data Volumes:
- Sales Transactions: ~777K records
- Customers: ~50K records
- Products: ~500 records
This script is IDEMPOTENT - safe to run multiple times

-- SECTION 1: DATABASE CONNECTION & VERIFICATION
-- =============================================================
-- 
-- IMPORTANT: UPDATE FILE PATHS FOR YOUR ENVIRONMENT
-- Before running Section 2, replace all file paths with your actual locations:
-- - Replace 'G:/WEBD CODES/DA Projects/Sales_Health_Monitor/' with your project path
-- - Ensure customers.csv is in Dataset/raw/ folder
-- - Ensure products.csv is in Dataset/raw/ folder  
-- - Ensure sales_cleaned.csv is in Dataset/processed/ folder
-- =============================================================

USE sales_health_monitor;
SELECT DATABASE() as current_database;
SELECT USER();

-- Verify table structure is ready
SHOW TABLES;

-- =============================================================
-- PRE-IMPORT STATUS CHECK
-- =============================================================

SELECT
'Pre-Import Status' as section,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers) AS customers_count,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products) AS products_count,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_transactions) AS transactions_count;

-- =============================================================
-- PRE-IMPORT CLEANUP (IDEMPOTENT DESIGN)
-- =============================================================
-- Clear existing data for fresh import

TRUNCATE TABLE sales_transactions;
TRUNCATE TABLE customers;
TRUNCATE TABLE products;

-- Reset auto-increment counters
ALTER TABLE ml_baselines AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;
ALTER TABLE kpi_results AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;

-- Confirm cleanup completed
SELECT
'After Cleanup' as section,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers) AS customers_count,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products) AS products_count,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_transactions) AS transactions_count;

-- =============================================================
-- IMPORT CAPABILITY VERIFICATION
-- =============================================================

-- Allow loading of local files (needed for LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE)
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';
-- If it says OFF, enable it:
SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;
-- Check secure directory (for future exports)
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv';

-- =============================================================
-- SECTION 2: CORE DATA IMPORT WITH WARNING DOCUMENTATION
-- =============================================================
-- IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT IMPORT WARNINGS:
-- The warnings "Delimiter '\r' in position 10 in datetime value" are caused by
-- Windows-style line endings (CRLF: '\r\n') in CSV files generated on Windows systems.
-- These warnings are NON-CRITICAL and do not affect:
-- ✓ Data integrity - All data imports correctly
-- ✓ Import success - All records imported successfully
-- ✓ Database functionality - Computed columns and relationships work perfectly
-- The warnings occur because MySQL detects trailing carriage return characters ('\r')
-- in datetime fields, which it considers non-standard spacing.
-- SAFE TO IGNORE: These warnings can be safely ignored for successful imports.
-- =============================================================

-- Step 1: Import Customers Data
-- UPDATE PATH: Replace with your actual file location

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'G:/WEBD CODES/DA Projects/Sales_Health_Monitor/Dataset/raw/customers.csv'
IGNORE
INTO TABLE customers
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS
(customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, segment, region, acquisition_date);

-- Validate customers import
SELECT 'Customers imported:' AS info, COUNT(*) AS count FROM customers;
SELECT customer_id, first_name, segment, region FROM customers LIMIT 3;

-- Step 2: Import Products Data
-- UPDATE PATH: Replace with your actual file location

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'G:/WEBD CODES/DA Projects/Sales_Health_Monitor/Dataset/raw/products.csv'
IGNORE
INTO TABLE products
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS
(product_id, product_name, category, price, cost, margin_percent, launch_date);

-- Validate products import
SELECT 'Products imported:' AS info, COUNT(*) AS count FROM products;
SELECT product_id, product_name, category, price FROM products LIMIT 3;

-- Step 3: Import Sales Transactions Data (Largest Dataset)
-- UPDATE PATH: Replace with your actual file location
-- Note: This import may show similar CRLF warnings - they are safe to ignore

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'G:/WEBD CODES/DA Projects/Sales_Health_Monitor/Dataset/processed/sales_cleaned.csv'
IGNORE
INTO TABLE sales_transactions
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS
(transaction_id, transaction_date, transaction_datetime, customer_id, customer_segment,
product_id, product_category, region, sales_channel, quantity, unit_price,
discount_percent, total_amount);

-- Validate sales transactions import
SELECT 'Sales transactions imported:' AS info, COUNT(*) AS count FROM sales_transactions;
SELECT transaction_id, transaction_date, customer_id, product_id, total_amount FROM sales_transactions LIMIT 3;

-- =============================================================
-- SECTION 2: FINAL VALIDATION & SUMMARY
-- =============================================================

-- Import summary
SELECT
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers) AS customers_loaded,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products) AS products_loaded,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_transactions) AS transactions_loaded;

-- Test computed columns functionality

SELECT transaction_id, transaction_date, year, month, quarter, day_of_week
FROM sales_transactions LIMIT 3;

-- Data quality check

SELECT
'Missing customer IDs:' AS check_type,
COUNT(*) AS count
FROM sales_transactions
WHERE customer_id IS NULL;

SELECT 'Section 2 Complete - Core Data Import Successful!' AS status;
