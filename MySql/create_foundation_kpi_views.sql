SALES HEALTH MONITOR - FOUNDATION KPI VIEWS CREATION
=============================================================

Project: Sales Health Monitor - Phase 5 MySQL Integration
Purpose: Create temporal and geographic KPI views for business intelligence
Author: Chirag Suri
Created: September 8, 2025
Version: 1.0 - Foundation KPI Views

Prerequisites:
- Database setup completed via database_setup.sql
- Core data imported via import_core_data.sql  
- ML baselines imported via import_ml_baselines.sql
- MySQL Workbench connected as sales_admin user

Key Metrics Framework:
- Seasonal patterns and trend analysis across all time periods
- Regional market share and performance distribution
- Product category revenue dominance and lifecycle patterns
- Customer intelligence segmentation and value contribution
- Anomaly detection baselines and threshold monitoring
- Customer health distribution and risk assessment

This script is IDEMPOTENT - safe to run multiple times
